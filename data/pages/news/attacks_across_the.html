Breaking News: Attacks across the Northern UK!
</p>

<p class="p1">
The United Kingdom has been broiled in civil war since the transform event, with Scotland spear heading the secessionist movement within the nation. The border between Scotland and England has the most concentration of attacks and conflict between the two sides. The latest attacks are isolated in Scotland with several bombing and shootings that appear to be against the known Anti-Mythìka cells in Scotland. Due to the locations of these attacks civilians casualties unfortunately happened and people are calling this a terror attack.
<br>
(Update: 6/25/2024) It has been confirmed that a group of dragons have committed this attack.
