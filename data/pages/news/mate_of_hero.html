An Anti Mythìka human shot Lockheed as he did a memorial speech at Venus Texas. This down had been brutally attacked with a cruise missal early this year by terrorists who were rumored to be part of UPAB. Lockheed was reported fine after ze had prompt medical attention to remove the bullet. At this point we encourage Mythìka to support the TRU if possible but no matter what don't be passive towards the likes of UPAB the anti mythìka want genocide and need to stopped.
